# Camera Motion Detector
This program detects any motion in the video when the camera is connected

## Description
This is a program that is enitirely written in python including it's libraries. I believe that after this program, many other big projects can come up, for example in aircraft engineering or rocket science. The computer's ability to detect motion of objects in a video is an important factor since this can also be used in our everday life, for example home surveillance that can trigger an alarm when an object passes infront of the camera.

## Requirements
This program does not require a lot to run. It needs opencv library for python, it is a library helps in computer based vision. To install this libary, type the following in the command line;

```
$ pip install opencv-python
```

It also uses tkinter for it's UI but this comes pre installed in python.
